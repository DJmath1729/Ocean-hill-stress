# Ocean-hill-stress
Code for the simulations in the preprint "Evaluating and improving wave and non-wave stress parametrisations for oceanic flows".

Separate code is given for 2d and 3d simulations. All code is written in Julia and uses the Oceananigans package. See the comments in the code for more details.
